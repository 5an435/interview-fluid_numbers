### Coding Challenge Guidelines
You have two 4-digit numbers as an input. Digits that are allowed to be used in the range from 1 to 9. For example, 1462 is a valid input, and 1034 is not. 
What is the least amount of operations it will take to go first one to the second number? Operations that you can use:
- add 1 to any digit. id is 1
- substruct 1 from any digit. id is 2
- right cyclic swap (1234 -> 4123). The next one
- left cyclic swap (1234 -> 2341). You got the idea

As an output, you must provide a list of operation IDs that will mutate one number to another. 

### Evaluation Criteria
Evaluation criteria are a set of private test cases. If they all pass problem is considered to be solved.

When you are ready create a branch {your_name}_{your_suname} and push you solution to it.
